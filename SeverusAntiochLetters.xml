               The transactions in the Christ-loving, believing city
               of the Paltians concerning Firminus have come to my
               notice, and I have agreed to them. Otherwise you
               would not have written, as may with most probability
               be inferred. It is however impossible to pass sentence
               upon a guilty man before he has had an opportunity
               of clef ence, having his accusers also face to face as is
               written.<note type="scriptureReference">Acts 25.16</note> 
               Therefore, as form requires, our judgment <pb n="46"/>
               actual men who are able to convict him, and to confirm
               the transactions regarding him, so that in this way we
               may cause him to be subjected to canonical sentences.
               For it is written, as your love of God who teach others
               also knows, "The innocent and righteous thou shalt
               not slay, and thou shalt not acquit the wicked."

            <p>
               Even in the case of things that are acknowledged
               and manifest we are not justified either by the form of
               human laws or by the ordinances of the Holy Spirit in
               judging on the statement of one side. Wherefore
               neither did we consent to agree to the things that were
               written by your devoutness ; not because we do not
               believe you, but to preserve the appearance that befits
               those who have been entrusted with the task of judging
               such matters.. The right and proper course would
               have been for your love of God to come as far as here :
               and then we would have summoned the other side also to
               come to us, and the truth would have been determined.
               Or, if they remained away and did not come when
               summoned, then the provisions laid down in the laws
               regarding those who remain away would have been
               plain and would have followed upon the act. For
               our own desire is not to leave the matter unheeded
               and unsettled. If the saintly Isidore, bishop of <pb n="53"/>
               the city of the men of Chalcis, had been present, we
               would have yielded to him the duty of giving judgment
               concerning places and persons in his jurisdiction.
               But, as he is absent, it is therefore absolutely necessary
               that we should ourselves, as I have said, lay down a
               just conclusion of the questions that have been stirred.
